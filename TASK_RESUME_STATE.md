# Task Resume State

## Original Prompt
For the coding problems, the "gRPC Service Definition" and "Hints" widget appears to the left of the code editor. Modify it so that the "gRPC Service Definition" and "Hints" is above the code editor so that the editor widget has enough width.

Add/modify unit and integration tests, ensure all tests pass (for all components) and no regressions. Ensure 100% code coverage. Commit and push to origin and deploy to GCP.

## Task Breakdown

### Phase 1: Explore Current Layout
- [ ] Find the component that renders the coding problem page
- [ ] Understand current layout structure (gRPC/Hints left of editor)
- [ ] Identify CSS/layout changes needed

### Phase 2: Modify Layout
- [ ] Move gRPC Service Definition above the code editor
- [ ] Move Hints above the code editor
- [ ] Ensure editor has full width
- [ ] Test responsive behavior

### Phase 3: Update Tests
- [ ] Add/modify component tests
- [ ] Ensure all tests pass
- [ ] Verify code coverage

### Phase 4: Deploy
- [ ] Commit changes
- [ ] Push to origin
- [ ] Deploy to GCP
- [ ] Verify deployment
