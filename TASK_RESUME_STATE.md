# Task Resume State

## Original Prompt
For the coding problems, the "gRPC Service Definition", "Hints" and "Test Scenarios" widgets appears alongside each other. Modify it so that the "gRPC Service Definition" is above the "Hints" and "Test Scenarios" widgets.

Add/modify unit and integration tests, ensure all tests pass (for all components) and no regressions. Ensure 100% code coverage. Commit and push to origin and deploy to GCP.

## Task Breakdown

### Phase 1: Modify Layout
- [ ] Update DistributedProblemDetail.tsx layout
- [ ] Put gRPC Service Definition in its own row above
- [ ] Put Hints and Test Scenarios side by side below gRPC

### Phase 2: Update Tests

### Phase 3: Deploy
- [ ] Commit changes
