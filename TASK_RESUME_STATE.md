# Task Resume State

## Original Prompt
Add the following system design problems with problem description, level selection, schema input, api spec, chat and diagram tool, review and submission, functional tests, performance tests and chaos tests similar to the existing system design problems:
1. Google Maps
2. Chatbot system like ChatGPT
3. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
4. Ride sharing service like Uber
5. Social networking website like Facebook

Add/modify unit and integration tests, ensure all tests pass (for all components) and no regressions. Ensure 100% code coverage. Commit and push to origin and deploy to GCP.
