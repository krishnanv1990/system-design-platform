# Claude Resume File - Task Progress

## Original Task
Add support for image formats (jpg, png, tiff) when importing/exporting diagrams. Currently the tool does not mention what formats are supported. Need to add clear format support and UI indication.

Requirements:
1. Add support for jpg, png, tiff and popular image formats for diagram export
2. Add unit and integration tests with 100% code coverage
3. Ensure all tests pass (for all components) and no regressions
4. Commit and push changes
5. Deploy and verify all functionality works
6. Save progress to resume file for crash recovery

## Progress
- Status: IN_PROGRESS
- Phase: Exploring codebase to find diagram import/export functionality

## Commands to Resume
```bash
cd /Users/macuser/tinker/system-design-platform
```
